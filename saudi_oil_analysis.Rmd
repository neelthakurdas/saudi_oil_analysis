## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r load-packages}
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(scales)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r load-data, message=FALSE}
term_paper_data <- read_csv("Downloads/term_paper_data - Sheet1 (1).csv")
View(term_paper_data)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
term_paper_long <- term_paper_data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(`Oil_Prices`, `GDP`), names_to = "Category", values_to = "Count") %>%
  select(Year, Category, Count) %>%
  arrange(Year)

term_paper_long$Count[term_paper_long$Category == "GDP"] <- term_paper_long$Count[term_paper_long$Category == "GDP"] / 1000000000

ggplot(term_paper_long, aes(x = Year, y = Count, color = Category)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::number_format(scale = 1e-0), 
                     sec.axis = sec_axis(~./1, labels = scales::comma, name = "Crude Oil Prices (in current US$ per cubic meter)")) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#009534", "#4C4244")) +
  ggtitle("Fig 1: Saudi Arabia GDP and Global Crude Oil Prices Over Time") +
  xlab("Year") + ylab("GDP (in billions of current US$)") + theme_bw()

correlation <- cor(term_paper_data$GDP, term_paper_data$Oil_Prices, method = "pearson")
print(correlation)
```
```{r}
term_paper_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = `Oil_Rents%GDP`)) + geom_col(fill = "#678d58") + theme_bw() + 
  labs(y = "Oil Rents (as a % of GDP)", x = "Year", title = "Fig 2: Saudi Arabia Oil Rents (as a % of GDP) Over Time")
```
```{r}
graphcolors = colorRampPalette(c("lightgreen", "darkgreen"))
newcolors <- graphcolors(8)

term_paper_long <- term_paper_data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(`GDP_Growth%`, `Oil_Prices_Growth%`), names_to = "Category", values_to = "Count") %>%
  select(Year, Category, Count) %>%
  arrange(Year)

term_paper_long %>%
  filter(Year >= 1980) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year)) + 
  geom_point(aes(y = Count, color = Category)) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = Count, color = Category)) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("lightgreen", "darkgreen")) +
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(x = "Year", title = "Fig 3: Saudi Arabia GDP Growth (%) and Oil Prices Growth (%) Over Time") +
  ylab("Oil Prices Growth (%)") +
